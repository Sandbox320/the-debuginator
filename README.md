# The Debuginator

A juicy feature-packed debug menu intended for games.

It's conceptually based on the debug menu I wrote at Fatshark for **Warhammer: End Times â€“ Vermintide**, where it was - and still is! - used extensively by everyone. Quote by one of the game designers during the Christmas party: *"The debug menu saved man-years for us"*. He was drunk. But not wrong.

Gifs will be added once project is slightly more complete.

## Current status

- Reference implementation in SDL kept up to par with all features.
- Performs well enough in terms of CPU speed. 10k - 200k items is a breeze on my work station.
- Memory wise it's a bit worse. It's not designed to be super cheap on memory (100-200 bytes per item depending on usage).
- Only built and tested with VS2015 & VS2017.
- A small amount of minor code TODOs stacked up.
- Simple unit testing. Small coverage at the moment.

## Features

These are subject to change and in various level of implementedness (including currently not at all).

- :heavy_check_mark: Done.
- :factory: Work in progress
- :small_blue_diamond: Some parts done, other parts on hold.
- :red_circle: Not started.

### :heavy_check_mark: STB-style single header library

Though tests, examples and plugins are in separate files/folders/projects.

### :heavy_check_mark: Easy to use

See documentation further down.

Or check out the SDL demo for information on how to initialize the debuginator and for more advanced uses.

### :heavy_check_mark: C99 compatible

So it's easy to add to any project. In one case I use an anonymous union (I pragma away the warning), so if your compiler doesn't support that, I recommend forking and fixing. I just like the convenience.

### :heavy_check_mark: Politely coded

No globals or static variables, in case you want to have it in a plugin and reload (or instantiate more than one).

Built using maximum warning levels and warnings as errors, tested with Cppcheck.

I do use #pragma to ignore a silly warning (see above).

### :heavy_check_mark: Allocates nothing

Only the memory buffer passed in at creation.

### :heavy_check_mark: No dependencies

For the library that is. It will include some headers but only if you don't provide overrides.

A font is included, and to build the SDL demo you need SDL 2 and SDL TTF.

### :heavy_check_mark: Scrollable

Can handle any number of items, the "hot" one will be centered (ish) smoothly.

Also supports scrolling with for example mouse wheel.

### :heavy_check_mark: Performant

Tested with 10000 menu items with no noticable hit on my laptop running a debug build. That's good enough for me! Hey, it's a debug menu.

### :heavy_check_mark: Search filter

Quickly and easily filter the items to find the one you want. Uses a fuzzy search mechanism to allow a user who isn't entirely sure what something is called to find it quickly. Adding a space to the search makes the filter run in "exact" mode; each part of the filter must be matched as-is.

Check my post on this for a bit of details about it: https://medium.com/@Srekel/implementing-a-fuzzy-search-algorithm-for-the-debuginator-cacc349e6c55

### :heavy_check_mark: Save/Load of settings

So you start up with the settings you had when you exited. Simple interface, application needs to handle the actual I/O.

### :heavy_check_mark: Dynamic add and remove of items

So you could, for example, have items that are only available when you are in the game's menu, or have one item for each spawned enemy in the game.

### :heavy_check_mark: Left or right aligned

Because some games already have other important stuff on the left side of the screen.

Hey, you could even have one instance of The Debuginator on the left and another on the right.

### :heavy_check_mark: Hierarchical

Put things in folders in folders in folders. They can be expanded and collapsed.

Folder states are saved across sessions. This is useful when you have a lot of items but different users are only interested in different subsets of them.

### :heavy_check_mark: Custom item editors

Different editors for different types of items, and support for users adding their own.

I'll add more customizability on request.

### :heavy_check_mark: Autodesk Stingray plugin available

Only builds as a static library for now, and it doesn't have a Lua API (just a C API). Supports the majority of the features but it's not done. I'm not likely to work further on it unless I start working on a Stingray project again.

### :heavy_check_mark: Input

The API for manouvering the menu is agnostic regarding keyboard/gamepad. It's handled at application layer, though guidelines for how to bind keys exist - see the demo.

Also supports mouse and touch input.

### :small_blue_diamond: Presets

Activate one item to activate a number of other ones. It works but the automated descriptions are not very good.

### :small_blue_diamond: Nice look & feel

Nice default color scheme, multiple themes to choose from, unique "editors" for different types of data, smooth animations, juicy feedback.

Yes, it's important.

### :factory: Reference implementation

Written in near-C C++ and SDL.

### :red_circle: Accordiony

No matter how far down or deep you scroll, you can always see the folders above the current item.

### :red_circle: Favorites

Set your most used ones. They will show up in a special folder near the top.

### :red_circle: Hotkeys

Press a key when debug menu is active to assign the current item/value. Press it again when menu is closed to toggle/set the value.

## Can I help?

Sure. This is my first public single-header C library. Any helpful comments or PRs appreciated.

## License

Similarly to STB's single header libraries: The Debuginator and other source files in this repository are in the public domain. You can do anything you want with them. You have no legal obligation to do anything else, although I appreciate attribution.

They are also licensed under the MIT open source license, if you have lawyers who are unhappy with public domain. Every source file includes an explicit dual-license for you to choose from.

Note that this does **NOT** include any folders that has LICENSE or README files that specifies their own license. They retain their own licenses.

# How to use the_debuginator.h

## Installation
Put the_debuginator.h somewhere in your project. It's an STB-style single header library and as such usage is a bit special.

Add this to *one* cpp file:

```C
#define DEBUGINATOR_IMPLEMENTATION
// #define DEBUGINATOR_OPTIONAL_SETTING_OR_OVERRIDE_X
// #define DEBUGINATOR_OPTIONAL_SETTING_OR_OVERRIDE_Y
// #define DEBUGINATOR_OPTIONAL_SETTING_OR_OVERRIDE_ETC
#include "path/to/the_debuginator.h"
```

## Setup

In the same cpp file:

```C
// Set up debuginator callbacks
void draw_text(const char* text, DebuginatorVector2* position, DebuginatorColor* color, DebuginatorFont* font, void* userdata) {
    // Your code goes here
}

void draw_rect(DebuginatorVector2* position, DebuginatorVector2* size, DebuginatorColor* color, void* userdata) {
    // Your code goes here
}

void word_wrap(const char* text, DebuginatorFont font, float max_width, unsigned* row_count, unsigned* row_lengths, int row_lengths_buffer_size, void* app_userdata) {
    // Your code goes here
}

void word_wrap2(const char* text, DebuginatorFont font, float max_width, char** buffer, int buffer_size, void* userdata) {
    // Your code goes here
}

DebuginatorVector2 text_size(const char* text, DebuginatorFont* font, void* userdata) {
    // Your code goes here
}

int main(...) {
    TheDebuginatorConfig config;
    debuginator_get_default_config(&config);

    config.memory_arena_capacity = 1024 * 512;
    config.memory_arena = (char*)malloc(config.memory_arena_capacity);

    config.draw_rect = draw_rect;
    config.draw_text = draw_text;
    config.word_wrap = word_wrap;
    config.text_size = text_size;

    config.size.x = 500;
    config.size.y = GetMyScreenResolution().y; // You need to calculate this.

    config.screen_resolution.x = config.size.x; // Yes these are temporary and will be removed.
    config.screen_resolution.y = config.size.y;

    // There's a bunch of other things you CAN change in the config, but these things
    // are the necessary stuff.

    config.create_default_debuginator_items = true; // I recommend this

    TheDebuginator debuginator;
    debuginator_create(&config, &debuginator);

    // debuginator is now the thing that you pass into the API functions to update/change/draw The Debuginator.
}
```

Actual usage, such as adding items or modifying settings, can be done from any c file.

## How to use

### The gist of it
This is the core for creating an item:

```C
DebuginatorItem* debuginator_create_array_item(TheDebuginator* debuginator,
	DebuginatorItem* parent, const char* path, const char* description,
	DebuginatorOnItemChangedCallback on_item_changed_callback, void* user_data,
	const char** value_titles, void* values, int num_values, int value_size)
```

Each *item* is defined by its path. If you create two items with the same path, only one will actually exist - with the data from the last call.

An *leaf item* has a list of *values*. A value has a title and a... value. The Debuginator doesn't care about what the values are, it just sees them as an array; a pointer and an element size. When you activate a value on an item, you'll get a callback with the value pointing to the correct place in that array. For bools, you don't really need to care about that stuff, it's handled by the wrapper function.

The leaf item also has a userdata field that you will use in your callbacks.

In addition to leaf items, there are folder items which currently doesn't really do anything in particular except be there. You don't need to create folder items before items, they'll be created implicitly if they don't already exist. You can pass NULL to the *parent* parameter, in fact, it's the most common use case. It's mainly there as an optimization.

### Saving and loading

I recommend looking at the SDL demo for a good example of how to do this. But here's how it works.

Saving is fairly straightforward. Call debuginator_save and pass in a callback that gets called for each item who's value is different from the default. I recommend storing it to a single key-value map, like "MyGame/MySetting = True".

Folders will also save their state if they are collapsed. This is so that they remain collapsed if you for example close the game down and open it up again.

### Examples

Here's how to add a boolean item that toggles god mode for the player:

```C
    struct Player {
        int health;
        bool godmode;
    }

    Player my_player;
    my_player.health = 100;
    my_player.godmode = false;

    debuginator_create_bool_item(
      &debuginator,
      "Player Mechanics/God Mode",
      "Player is invincible if enabled",
      &my_player.godmode);
```

Here's how to create a preset item - it'll toggle multiple things.

```C
    const char* preset_paths[2] = { "Workflow/Skip intro", "Player Mechanics/God Mode" };
    const char* preset_value_titles[2] = { "True", "True" };
    debuginator_create_preset_item(&debuginator,
    		"My Presets/Good workflow",
		preset_paths, preset_value_titles, NULL, 2);
```

Here's how to create a generic item with a few strings and no callback (not sure what use case there is for that, but hey)... If you look at the definition of the other create_item functions, you'll see that they simply wrap this one.

```C
	{
		static const char* string_titles[5] = { "String A", "String B", "String C", "String D", "String E" };
		debuginator_create_array_item(&debuginator,
			NULL, "My Game/String Test",
			"Multiple strings.", NULL, NULL,
			string_titles, NULL, 5, 0);
	}
```

Here's how to create a generic item with multiple things WITH a callback.

```C
	void on_change_ui_size(DebuginatorItem* item, void* value, const char* value_title, void* app_userdata) {
		(void)value_title;
		TheDebuginatorWrapper* wrapper = (TheDebuginatorWrapper*)app_userdata;
		int size_category = *(int*)value;
		if (size_category == 0) {
			set_ui_size(&wrapper->debuginator, 14, 22);
		}
		else if (size_category == 1) {
			set_ui_size(&wrapper->debuginator, 20, 30);
		}
		else if (size_category == 2) {
			set_ui_size(&wrapper->debuginator, 32, 40);
		}
		else if (size_category == 3) {
			set_ui_size(&wrapper->debuginator, 64, 70);
		}
	}

// Later...

		static const char* uisize_titles[4] = { "Small", "Medium", "Large", "ULTRA LARGE" };
		static int uisizes[4] = { 0, 1, 2, 3 };
		DebuginatorItem* uisize_item = debuginator_create_array_item(debuginator,
			NULL, "Debuginator/UI size",
			"Change font and item size.", on_change_ui_size, wrapper,
			uisize_titles, uisizes, 4, sizeof(uisizes[0]));
```

## A note on memory

The Debuginator uses (what I call) a block allocator. It's slightly wasteful in terms of memory but should be pretty efficient for allocating and deallocating.

You provide a buffer for The Debuginator to use, and it'll use that. When there's no more memory.. it'll probably crash or something.

If you want to give The Debuginator a string for it to own (and deallocate), you can do that. Look at:
```C
char* debuginator_copy_string(TheDebuginator* debuginator, const char* string, int length);
```

## API

You know, it's best to just look in the header file and see which functions are exposed, but... here's the API such as it is currently. There's additional information in the code.

```C
bool debuginator_is_open(TheDebuginator* debuginator);
void debuginator_set_open(TheDebuginator* debuginator, bool open);

DebuginatorItem* debuginator_create_array_item(TheDebuginator* debuginator,
	DebuginatorItem* parent, const char* path, const char* description,
	DebuginatorOnItemChangedCallback on_item_changed_callback, void* user_data,
	const char** value_titles, void* values, int num_values, int value_size);

DebuginatorItem* debuginator_create_bool_item(TheDebuginator* debuginator, const char* path, const char* description, void* user_data);
DebuginatorItem* debuginator_create_preset_item(TheDebuginator* debuginator, const char* path, const char** paths, const char** value_titles, int** value_indices, int num_paths);

DebuginatorItem* debuginator_create_folder_item(TheDebuginator* debuginator, DebuginatorItem* parent, const char* title, int title_length);
DebuginatorItem* debuginator_get_item(TheDebuginator* debuginator, DebuginatorItem* parent, const char* path, bool create_if_not_exist);
void debuginator_set_hot_item(TheDebuginator* debuginator, const char* path);
DebuginatorItem* debuginator_get_hot_item(TheDebuginator* debuginator);
void debuginator_remove_item(TheDebuginator* debuginator, DebuginatorItem* item);
void debuginator_remove_item_by_path(TheDebuginator* debuginator, const char* path);

int debuginator_save(TheDebuginator* debuginator, DebuginatorSaveItemCallback callback, char* save_buffer, int save_buffer_size);
void debuginator_load_item(TheDebuginator* debuginator, const char* path, const char* value_title);
void debuginator_set_default_value(TheDebuginator* debuginator, const char* path, const char* value_title, int value_index); // value index is used if value_title == NULL
void debuginator_set_edit_type(TheDebuginator* debuginator, const char* path, DebuginatorItemEditorDataType edit_type);

void debuginator_activate(TheDebuginator* debuginator, DebuginatorItem* item);

void debuginator_move_to_next_leaf(TheDebuginator* debuginator, bool long_move);
void debuginator_move_to_prev_leaf(TheDebuginator* debuginator, bool long_move);
void debuginator_move_to_child(TheDebuginator* debuginator, bool toggle_and_activate);
void debuginator_move_to_parent(TheDebuginator* debuginator);

bool debuginator_is_filtering_enabled(TheDebuginator* debuginator);
void debuginator_set_filtering_enabled(TheDebuginator* debuginator, bool enabled);
char* debuginator_get_filter(TheDebuginator* debuginator);
void debuginator_update_filter(TheDebuginator* debuginator, const char* wanted_filter);

void debuginator_set_item_height(TheDebuginator* debuginator, int item_height);
void debuginator_set_size(TheDebuginator* debuginator, int width, int height);

# How to run the Unit Test

Open the Visual Studio solution. Build it. Set the *unittest* project as the StartUp project. Run.

Note: The SDL demo project won't build until you fix the dependencies so you might want to unload it.

# How to run the SDL demo

Open the Visual Studio solution. Build it. Set the *sdl* project as the StartUp project. Run.

You'll need dependencies to build it. Get SDL 2 and SDLTTF 2. I'll update this with better instructions at some point. :)

# How to use Stingray Plugin

## Installation

Add it to your project and build it. Currently it just builds as static library, sorry about that.

## Setup

Somewhere in your project's code:

```C
	PluginManagerApi *plugin_manager_api = (PluginManagerApi*)get_engine_api(PLUGIN_MANAGER_API_ID);
	TheDebuginatorApi* debuginator_api = (TheDebuginatorApi*)plugin_manager_api->get_next_plugin_api(THE_DEBUGINATOR_API_ID, NULL);
	ScriptApi* script_api = (ScriptApi*)get_engine_api(C_API_ID);

	TheDebuginatorConfig config;
	ASSERT(debuginator_api->get_default_config != NULL, "Debugintor plugin not loaded.");
	debuginator_api->get_default_config(&config);

	config.memory_arena_capacity = 1024 * 32;
	config.size.x = 500;

	DebuginatorPluginCreateContext create_context = { 0 };
	create_context.config = config;
	create_context.gui = gui;
	create_context.font = hash64("core/performance_hud/debug");
	create_context.font_material = script_api->Gui->material(my_gui, create_context.font);

	debuginator_api->create_debuginator(NULL, &create_context);
```

## Update

```C
	void update(float dt) {
		TheDebuginator* debuginator = debuginator_api->get_debuginator(NULL);
		int devices = Debuginator_Keyboard | Debuginator_Gamepad;
		debuginator_api->handle_default_input(debuginator, devices);
	}
```
## That's it?

That's it. Basically. The plugin automatically handles a few things for you. You don't have to call handle_default_input if you want to implement your own control scheme, and you can edit the config and create context however you wish.
